    <h1> CPR  </h1>
    
    <p>

 
    Cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR has gone through some changes in the years, but there are some basic actions that could be done by anyone who is around. First, if the person is not responding, you should make the emergency call. Second, if the person is not breathing, tilt the person's head and give one-second mouth to mouth breaths. Third, you should also give chest compressions and if the condition is serious combine it with mouth to mouth respiration until the person starts breathing himself.

    <h1>  SNAKEBITE </h1>

    <p >
        If anyone is bitten by a snake that seems to be poisonous, the first thing you should do is calm the person and ask him or her to stay still. Try not to move the body part that is bitten so that the spreading of poison is slow in the body. Make an emergency call and remove any jewelry before swelling starts. If you have seen the snake, try to remember the size and colouration of the snake if possible so that the treatment can be done accordingly.

   <h1>  CONTROLLING BLEEDING </h1>
    <p>
        Clean your hand first and wear clean gloves or a clean plastic bag.
Have the person lie down with the bleeding site elevated.
Remove dirt or debris from the wound.
Apply continuous pressure with a clean cloth or bandage for 20 minutes without removing.
If the bleeding persists, apply pressure to the artery.
When bleeding stops, do not move the body part and leave the bandage also in place.

	<h1> HELP WITH CHOKING  </h1>
    <p>
        
        If anyone is choking and cannot breathe, there is a technique called Heimlich maneuver which can be learned to save someone when choking. The technique differs in the case of child, infant and adult. It is very important to learn the technique properly before doing it because if not done correctly, it can do more harm than good.

    <h1> BURNS  </h1>

    <p>
        Although large and severe burns are treated by medical professionals, you can at least give first aid to them before they receive any treatment. However, for small or not so severe burns you can opt for treating it at home also. Run cold water over the burn for at least 10 minutes. If pain persists, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be given.

        Usually people who are diabetic suffer from hypoglycemia if they skip or delay a meal or snack, take more insulin than required, exercise or take alcohol without eating carbohydrates. No matter what the case is you can give the person a small chocolate, 1 tablespoon of honey, jam or jelly, 1 tablespoon of sugar in water or offer 1/2 cup of fruit juice or even take some fruit like apple, orange, raisins, few grapes or 1/2 banana
