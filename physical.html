	   <h1> SORE MUSCLES
        </h1>
		<p>
    To help relieve muscle soreness, try:
    <br>
    1. Gentle stretching.<br>
    2. Muscle massage.<br>
    3. Rest.<br>
    4. Ice to help reduce inflammation.<br>
    5. Heat to help increase blood flow to your muscles. Even a warm bath or shower can help.<br>
    6. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicine, such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen (brand name: Advil).<br>
    7. OTC creams and gels (brand names: IcyHot and Aspercreme) that contain menthol or capsaicin can ease muscle soreness.<br><br>

	  <h1> SPRAINED ANKLE
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you have a mild or moderate injury, consider these sprained ankle remedies:<br>
1. Rest: Stay off the injury for a few days, and get ample rest.<br>
2. Ice: Apply cold to the ankle several times a day to help reduce pain and swelling.<br>
3. Compression: Apply a static or elastic compression bandage to help limit swelling.<br>
4. Elevation: Reduce the flow of blood and other fluids to the injury site by elevating the ankle above the heart.<br><br>
TC Pain Medication<br>
1. Although a sprained ankle is not typically a serious injury, it may still be painful. If you find the discomfort too much to handle, consider taking an over-the-counter pain medication that may help reduce the pain and swelling.2 Check with your doctor if you’re on other medications, and always follow the dosage instructions to ensure proper use.<br>
2. Epsom Salt<br>
3. After a few days, you can soak your ankle in a warm bath with Epsom salt. It’s important to apply cold during the first few days after an injury. Epsom salt may help soothe sore muscles and connective tissues, and it may help with joint stiffness. Try adding Epsom salts to a warm or somewhat hot bath 1-2 times per day. <br><br>
Natural Poultices<br>
4. A variety of natural anti-inflammatory ingredients can be found in your pantry. If you want to try a traditional poultice to help reduce swelling, consider turmeric, garlic, onion, castor oil, or olive oil. Gently heat any of these ingredients and apply to a sprained ankle, and then wrap the ankle in a bandage for several hours. Research on the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory foods is mixed, but these foods are unlikely to harm you and may promote healing.<br><br>

		<h1> SHOULDER DISLOCATION
        </h1>

        <p>
             Try these steps to help ease discomfort and encourage healing after being treated for a dislocated shoulder:<br>
            1. Rest your shoulder. Don't repeat the specific action that caused your        shoulder to dislocate, and try to avoid painful movements. Limit heavy lifting  or overhead activity until your shoulder feels better.<br>
            2.  Apply ice then heat. Putting ice on your shoulder helps reduce inflammation and pain. Use a cold pack, a bag of frozen vegetables or a towel filled with ice cubes for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Do this every couple of hours the first day or two.<br>
            3. After two or three days, when the pain and inflammation have improved, hot packs or a heating pad may help relax tight and sore muscles. Limit heat applications to 20 minutes at a time.<br>
            4. Take pain relievers. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), may help relieve pain. Follow label directions and stop taking the drugs when the pain improves.<br>
            5. Maintain the range of motion of your shoulder. After one or two days, do some gentle exercises as directed by your doctor or physical therapist to help maintain your shoulder's range of motion. Inactivity can cause stiff joints. In addition, favoring your shoulder for a long period can lead to frozen shoulder, a condition in which your shoulder becomes so stiff you can barely move it.<br>
           6. Once your injury heals and you have good range of motion in your shoulder, continue exercising. Daily shoulder stretches and a shoulder-strengthening and stability program can help prevent a recurrence of dislocation. Your doctor or a physical therapist can help you plan an appropriate exercise routine.<br><br>

        <h1> NECK PAIN
        </h1>

        <p >
            If you have minor neck pain or stiffness, take these simple steps to relieve it:<br>
1. Apply ice for the first few days. After that, apply heat with a heating pad, hot compress, or by taking a hot shower.<br>
2. Take OTC pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.<br>
3. Take a few days off from sports, activities that aggravate your symptoms, and heavy lifting. When you resume normal activity, do so slowly as your symptoms ease.<br>
4. Exercise your neck every day. Slowly stretch your head in side-to-side and up-and-down motions.<br>
5. Practice good posture.<br><br>
6. Avoid cradling the phone between your neck and shoulder.<br>
7. Change your position often. Don’t stand or sit in one position for too long.<br>
8. Get a gentle neck massage.<br>
9. Use a special neck pillow for sleeping.<br>
10. Don’t use a neck brace or collar without your doctor’s approval. If you don’t use them properly, they can make your symptoms worse.<br><br>
